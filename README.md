# Portfolio Website

## Overview
This project is a personal portfolio website for **Ahammed Shameem**, showcasing skills, projects, and contact details. It provides a clean and professional interface for potential employers or clients to learn more about Ahammed's expertise and work.

## Features
- **Introduction Section**: A header that introduces Ahammed Shameem as a Web Developer and Designer.
- **About Section**: Highlights the developer's passion for web development and a brief personal introduction.
- **Skills Section**: Lists the technical skills, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Responsive Design.
- **Projects Section**: Displays completed projects with images, descriptions, and links to view the projects.
- **Contact Section**: Provides contact information such as email and phone number.
- **Footer**: Includes a copyright statement.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the website.
- `styles.css`: External CSS file for styling the website.

## Requirements
- A web browser to view the website.
- An internet connection is required if external resources (e.g., fonts) are used.
- Local assets (e.g., project images) should be correctly linked for proper display.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure all assets (e.g., images, `styles.css`) are in their appropriate locations.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Customization
- Update the `index.html` file to reflect new skills, projects, or contact details.
- Replace the placeholder project links with actual links to live projects.
- Modify the `styles.css` file to change the appearance of the website.
- Replace the image paths with accessible URLs or files.

## Issues to Address
- **Local Image Paths**: The image paths reference files on a local drive (e.g., `C:\Users\ahame\Downloads\`). Replace these with relative paths or URLs for proper display.
- **Project Links**: Add actual URLs for the project links in the "View Project" buttons.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a navigation bar for better user experience.
- Implement responsive styling for improved usability across devices.
- Include animations for a more interactive and dynamic website.
- Add a "Download Resume" button or a "Blog" section for additional content.
